### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Helmi-Megdiche/Lifeline.git
   cd Lifeline
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd lifeline-backend
   npm install
   
   # Frontend
   cd ../lifeline-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Backend - Create .env file
   cd lifeline-backend
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your MongoDB connection string
   ```

4. **Start the applications**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd lifeline-backend
   npm run start:dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd lifeline-app
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the app**
   - **Desktop**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Mobile**: http://[YOUR_IP]:3000 (see Mobile Access section)

## 📱 Mobile Access

### For Mobile Testing

1. **Find your network IP**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   ipconfig
   
   # Look for WiFi adapter IPv4 Address
   # Example: 10.133.250.197
   ```

2. **Update configuration** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # The app automatically uses your WiFi IP
   # Check lifeline-app/src/lib/config.ts
   ```

3. **Access from mobile**
   ```
   http://[YOUR_IP]:3000
   # Example: http://10.133.250.197:3000
   ```

### HTTPS for Geolocation (Mobile)

Mobile browsers require HTTPS for geolocation. Choose one option:

#### Option A: Chrome Flag (Easiest)
1. Open Chrome on mobile
2. Go to: `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`
3. Add: `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000`
4. Restart Chrome

#### Option B: HTTPS Setup
```bash
cd lifeline-app
npm run setup-https
npm run dev:https
# Then use: https://[YOUR_IP]:3000
```

#### Option C: ngrok (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g ngrok
ngrok http 3000
# Use the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PouchDB (local) + IndexedDB (legacy)
- **Maps**: Leaflet with React-Leaflet
- **PWA**: next-pwa with custom service worker

### Backend (NestJS)
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport
- **Sync Protocol**: CouchDB-compatible PouchDB endpoints
- **CORS**: Configured for mobile access
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer integration for password reset emails
- **Profile Management**: RESTful API for user profile updates

### Data Model
- **Single Document per User**: `user_<userId>_status`
- **Status History**: Local-only array for offline changes
- **Revisions**: CouchDB-style `_rev` for conflict resolution
- **User Isolation**: JWT-enforced data separation
