# Authentication Issues Debug Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: CORS Headers Issue
**Problem**: `Request header field pragma is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response`

**Solution**: Added `'pragma'` to the `allowedHeaders` array in `lifeline-backend/src/main.ts`

```typescript
allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'cache-control', 'pragma'],
```

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED: PouchDB _local Endpoint Handling
**Problem**: The `_local` endpoints were throwing `NotFoundException` which was being converted to 401 errors

**Solution**: Modified the alerts controller to return proper 404 responses with CouchDB-style error format:

```typescript
@Get('pouch/_local/:docId')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
async getLocalDoc(@Request() req, @Param('docId') docId: string, @Res() res: any) {
  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'not_found', reason: 'missing' });
}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ VERIFIED: JWT Token Validity
**Status**: JWT tokens are working correctly for regular endpoints
- Auth test endpoint: ‚úÖ 200 OK
- Alerts pouch endpoint: ‚úÖ 200 OK
- _local endpoints: ‚úÖ 404 (expected behavior)

## Root Cause Analysis

The "401 Unauthorized" errors you were seeing were actually **misleading**. Here's what was happening:

1. **PouchDB Checkpoint Requests**: PouchDB makes requests to `_local` endpoints to check for replication checkpoints
2. **Expected 404 Response**: These endpoints correctly return 404 (document not found) because checkpoints don't exist yet
3. **PouchDB Error Interpretation**: PouchDB was somehow interpreting the 404 as a 401, possibly due to:
   - Error handling middleware converting exceptions to 401s
   - CORS preflight issues causing authentication failures
   - PouchDB's internal error mapping

## Testing Results

### Backend Endpoints Tested:
```bash
# Auth endpoint - ‚úÖ Working
GET /auth/test with JWT token ‚Üí 200 OK

# Alerts pouch info - ‚úÖ Working  
GET /alerts/pouch with JWT token ‚Üí 200 OK

# _local endpoint - ‚úÖ Fixed (now returns proper 404)
GET /alerts/pouch/_local/test123 with JWT token ‚Üí 404 {"error":"not_found","reason":"missing"}
```

## Debugging Steps Added

I've added enhanced logging to the frontend to help you see exactly what's happening:

1. **Response Status Logging**: Now logs the actual HTTP status codes
2. **Error Categorization**: Distinguishes between network errors and HTTP errors
3. **Token Validation**: Logs token presence and format

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your backend** to apply the CORS and endpoint fixes
2. **Test the sync again** - you should now see proper 404 responses instead of 401s
3. **Monitor the console logs** - the enhanced logging will show you exactly what's happening

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- ‚úÖ CORS errors should be resolved
- ‚úÖ _local endpoint requests should return proper 404s (not 401s)
- ‚úÖ PouchDB sync should work correctly
- ‚úÖ Manual sync should complete successfully

## Console Log Patterns to Look For

**Good (Expected)**:
```
üì° Response status: 404 for URL: http://10.133.250.197:4004/alerts/pouch/_local/...
‚ùå Response not ok: 404 Not Found
```

**Bad (Should be fixed)**:
```
‚ùå Response not ok: 401 Unauthorized
```

The 404 responses are **normal and expected** for _local endpoints that don't exist yet. PouchDB will create them as needed during sync.
