# Groups Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Failed to fetch group details" Error

**Problem:** The group details page was showing "Failed to fetch group details" error.

**Root Cause:** The frontend was using `Promise.all()` which would fail if either API call failed, even though the status summary is optional.

**Fix Applied:**
- Separated the two API calls
- Made status summary optional (wrapped in try-catch)
- Added better error logging
- Error messages now show HTTP status codes

**Changes in `lifeline-app/src/app/groups/[id]/page.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Before: Promise.all() - fails if either fails
// After: Sequential fetch with error handling

try {
  // Fetch group details (required)
  const detailsResponse = await fetch(...);
  if (!detailsResponse.ok) throw new Error(...);
  const data = await detailsResponse.json();
  setGroupDetails(data);

  // Fetch status summary (optional)
  if (data.memberCount > 0) {
    try {
      const statusResponse = await fetch(...);
      if (statusResponse.ok) setStatusCounts(...);
    } catch { /* optional */ }
  }
} catch (err) { /* handle */ }
```

### 2. Groups Not Being Deleted from MongoDB

**Problem:** When deleting a group, it disappeared from UI but remained in MongoDB database.

**Root Cause:** The delete permission check was incorrect. It was checking `group.ownerId.toString() !== userId` which required both type casting, and it didn't allow admins to delete (only owners).

**Fix Applied:**
- Allow both owners AND admins to delete groups
- Use proper type casting with `(group.ownerId as any)`
- Added member record lookup to check admin status

**Changes in `lifeline-backend/src/groups/groups.service.ts`:**
```typescript
async deleteGroup(groupId: string, userId: string): Promise<void> {
  const group = await this.groupModel.findById(groupId);
  if (!group) throw new NotFoundException('Group not found');
  
  // Check if user is owner OR admin
  const member = await this.memberModel.findOne({ groupId, userId });
  const isOwner = (group.ownerId as any).toString() === userId;
  const isAdmin = member?.role === 'admin';
  
  // Allow deletion if user is owner or admin
  if (!isOwner && !isAdmin) {
    throw new ForbiddenException('Only the group owner or admins can delete this group');
  }
  
  // Delete all members
  await this.memberModel.deleteMany({ groupId });
  
  // Delete the group
  await this.groupModel.findByIdAndDelete(groupId);
}
```

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Better Error Messages
- Console logs show HTTP status codes
- Error messages include more detail
- Frontend shows specific error reasons

### 2. Status Summary
- Now optional (won't break if status endpoint fails)
- Only fetched if group has members
- Gracefully handles API failures

### 3. Delete Button Logic
- Shows delete button for admins AND temp groups
- Proper permission checking
- Backend validates again (security)

## Testing

Try these scenarios:

1. **View Group Details:**
   - Click on any group
   - Should see members list and status summary
   - Should not show error page

2. **Delete Group:**
   - As owner/admin, delete a group
   - Check MongoDB - group should be completely removed
   - Members should also be deleted

3. **Delete Offline:**
   - Go offline
   - Delete a group
   - Should remove from UI immediately
   - Should sync deletion when back online

## Backend Changes

**File:** `lifeline-backend/src/groups/groups.service.ts`
- `deleteGroup()`: Now checks for both owner and admin roles
- Proper type casting to avoid TypeScript errors
- Logs kept minimal (no console.log spam)

## Frontend Changes

**File:** `lifeline-app/src/app/groups/[id]/page.tsx`
- Separated API calls (details vs status)
- Better error handling and logging
- Status summary is now optional
- Shows detailed error messages

**File:** `lifeline-app/src/contexts/GroupsContext.tsx`
- Optimistic delete (removes from UI immediately)
- Syncs deletion when back online
- Handles temp group deletion
- Proper cache cleanup

## Result

✅ Groups now delete properly from MongoDB  
✅ Group details page works without errors  
✅ Better error messages for debugging  
✅ Admins can now delete groups they manage  
✅ Offline deletion works and syncs properly
