# Clear Browser Cache and Service Worker

## The Problem
The backend is working correctly (returning 200 OK), but the frontend is still getting cached 401 responses. This is likely due to:

1. **Browser Cache**: Cached 401 responses from before our fixes
2. **Service Worker Cache**: The service worker is caching responses
3. **PouchDB Internal Cache**: PouchDB might be caching failed requests

## Solution Steps

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or go to Application tab → Storage → Clear storage → Clear site data

### 2. Clear Service Worker Cache
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Service Workers" in the left sidebar
4. Find your service worker and click "Unregister"
5. Go to "Storage" → "Cache Storage"
6. Delete all cache entries
7. Refresh the page

### 3. Clear PouchDB Cache
Add this to your browser console:
```javascript
// Clear PouchDB local database
if (window.localStorage) {
  Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
    if (key.includes('pouchdb') || key.includes('lifeline')) {
      localStorage.removeItem(key);
    }
  });
}

// Clear IndexedDB
if (window.indexedDB) {
  indexedDB.deleteDatabase('lifeline-local');
  indexedDB.deleteDatabase('lifeline-local-68f7ae94d8e811421f98b5bc');
}
```

### 4. Force Fresh Requests
I've added cache-busting headers to the frontend code:
- `Cache-Control: no-cache`
- `Pragma: no-cache`

This should prevent future caching issues.

### 5. Test the Fix
1. Clear all caches (steps 1-3)
2. Refresh the page
3. Try the manual sync again
4. Check the console logs for the new debugging information

## Expected Results
After clearing the cache, you should see:
- ✅ 200 OK responses instead of 401 Unauthorized
- ✅ Proper 404 responses for _local endpoints
- ✅ Successful sync operations

## Debug Information
The enhanced logging will now show:
- 📡 Actual HTTP status codes
- 📄 Response bodies for failed requests
- 🔑 Token information
- 🌐 Request URLs

This will help identify any remaining issues.
