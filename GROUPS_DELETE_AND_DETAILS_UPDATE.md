# Groups Delete & Details Feature Update

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Delete Groups Functionality**
- **Backend**: Already implemented in service (only owner can delete)
- **Frontend**: Added delete button to group cards
- **UI**: Delete button appears at bottom of each group card for admins
- **Logic**:
  - Only shows delete button if `group.isAdmin` is true
  - Optimistic update - removes from UI immediately
  - Works online and offline (queues for sync)
  - Removes from cache automatically
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion

### 2. **Group Details Page**
- **Status Summary**: Visual dashboard showing counts for each status type
  - ✅ Safe (green)
  - ⚠️ Need Help (yellow)
  - 🆘 In Danger (red)
  - ❌ Offline (gray)
  - ❓ Unknown (gray)
- **Members List**: 
  - Shows all members with their status
  - Displays username and email
  - Shows "(You)" badge for current user
  - Admin badge for administrators
  - Status icons and labels
- **Status Update Buttons**:
  - "I'm Safe" (✅)
  - "Need Help" (⚠️)
  - "In Danger" (🆘)
- **Delete Button**: Only shown if user is admin/owner

### 3. **Backend Updates**
- **getUserGroups**: Now returns `isAdmin` flag for each group
- **getGroupDetails**: Now properly sets `isAdmin` based on role or ownership
- Admin status determined by:
  - User is group owner, OR
  - User has admin role in the group

## 🎨 UI Features

### Groups List Card Updates
```typescript
// Each group card now has:
- Clickable area (top section) - navigates to details
- Delete button (bottom section) - only for admins
- Admin badge - shows if user is admin
- Pending badge - shows for offline-created groups
- Member count display
```

### Group Details Page Features
```typescript
// Status Summary Section:
- Grid of 5 cards showing status counts
- Color-coded (green, yellow, red, gray)
- Visual icons (✅ ⚠️ 🆘 ❌ ❓)

// Members List:
- Each member shows:
  * Status icon
  * Username (with "(You)" for current user)
  * Admin badge if applicable
  * Email address
  * Status badge with color coding

// Actions:
- Three status update buttons
- Delete group button (admin only)
```

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Delete Permissions
- **Backend**: Only group owner can delete
- **Frontend**: Only shows delete button to admins
- **Validation**: Backend double-checks on server side

### View Permissions
- **Backend**: Only group members can view details
- **Forbidden**: Non-members get 403 error

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Test Delete as Owner/Admin**:
   - Create a group (you become admin)
   - Click "Delete Group" on the card
   - Confirm deletion
   - Group should disappear immediately

2. **Test Group Details**:
   - Click on any group card
   - View status summary
   - View members list
   - Update your status
   - Check member statuses

3. **Test Delete Button Visibility**:
   - Only groups where you're admin show delete button
   - Regular members don't see the button

## 📝 Code Changes

### Backend (`groups.service.ts`)
- `getUserGroups`: Added `isAdmin` calculation
- `getGroupDetails`: Fixed `isAdmin` to check both role and ownership

### Frontend (`groups/page.tsx`)
