# Groups Module Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Group creation failing with `ownerId` validation error during sync

**Root Cause:** The groups controller was using `req.user.id` instead of `req.user.userId`, which didn't match the JWT strategy structure.

## Changes Made

### File: `lifeline-backend/src/groups/groups.controller.ts`

**Changed:** All instances of `req.user.id` to `req.user.userId`

- `createGroup`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `getUserGroups`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `getGroupDetails`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `updateGroup`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `deleteGroup`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `addMember`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `getGroupMembers`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `removeMember`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `updateMemberRole`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`
- `updateMemberStatus`: Already using `userId` parameter correctly
- `getGroupStatus`: `req.user.id` → `req.user.userId`

### Why This Matters

The JWT strategy in `lifeline-backend/src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts` returns:
```typescript
return { userId: user._id, username: user.username };
```

So the request object uses `userId`, not `id`. This is why all other controllers use `req.user.userId`.

## Testing

Now when you:
1. Go offline
2. Create a group
3. Come back online

The pending action will sync successfully because:
- The JWT token includes the user ID
- The controller can now extract `req.user.userId`
- The group is created with the correct `ownerId`
- The member record is created with the correct `userId`

## Result

✅ Offline group creation now syncs properly when coming back online
✅ No more "ownerId required" errors
✅ Groups are created with correct ownership
✅ Users are automatically added as admin members
